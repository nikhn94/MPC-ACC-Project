title = "Design and implementation of parameterized adaptive cruise control : an explicit model predictive control approach",
abstract = "The combination of different characteristics and situation-dependent behavior cause the design of adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems to be time consuming. This paper presents a systematic approach for the design of a parameterized ACC, based on explicit model predictive control. A unique feature of the synthesized ACC is its parameterization in terms of key characteristics, which, after the parameterization, makes it easy and intuitive to tune, even for the driver. The effectiveness of the design approach is demonstrated using simulations for relevant traffic scenarios, including Stop-&-Go. On-the-road experiments show the proper functioning of the synthesized ACC.",
